# PYTHON-Repo: Python Assignments, Practice, and Projects

Welcome to my **PYTHON-Repo**! This repository is dedicated to all things Python. It contains a collection of assignments, practice code, and larger projects Iâ€™ve been working on. The repository is organized into three main sections:

- **Assignments**: Python files for all the assignments completed for my courses.
- **Practice**: Personal Python practice scripts and exercises to improve my coding skills.
- **Projects**: Larger, more complex Python projects, including final projects, applications, and other significant works.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

### **Assignments/**
This folder contains Python files related to my course assignments. Each file focuses on solving specific problems or topics from different subjects I am studying.

### **Practice/**
This folder contains Python code snippets, exercises, and other small projects I worked on to practice Python concepts, including algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving.

### **Projects/**
This folder contains more complex Python projects I have worked on, including personal projects or final projects from courses. These projects often involve multiple files, so each project may have its own subfolder.

## How to Use

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PYTHON-Repo.git
